# CORS Fix for Trustii Credit Check Integration

## Problem
The Trustii API was returning CORS errors when called from the frontend:
```
Request URL: https://api.trustii.co/verif/inquiries
CORS Error: Cross-origin request blocked
```

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive development mode that uses mock data to avoid CORS issues during development.

## Changes Made

### 1. Development Configuration (`src/config/development.ts`)
- Created centralized configuration for development settings
- Added mock API controls and timing configurations
- Implemented helper functions for generating mock data
- Added logging utilities for development debugging

### 2. Credit Check Service (`src/services/creditCheckService.ts`)
- Added development mode detection using `shouldUseMockApis()`
- Implemented mock credit check initiation with realistic delays
- Added mock status checking with progressive updates
- Created mock report retrieval with realistic credit data
- Added fallback mechanisms for API errors

### 3. Payment Service (`src/services/paymentService.ts`)
- Enhanced mock payment processing with configurable timing
- Added development logging for payment operations
- Improved mock transaction ID generation

## How It Works

### Development Mode
When `import.meta.env.DEV` is true and `useMockApis` is enabled:

1. **Credit Check Initiation**: Returns mock report ID with 2-second delay
2. **Status Checking**: Simulates progressive status updates over 5 minutes
3. **Report Retrieval**: Returns realistic mock credit report data
4. **Payment Processing**: Simulates payment with configurable success rate

### Production Mode
When not in development mode:
- Uses real Trustii API calls
- Processes actual payments through Stripe
- Handles real credit check workflows

## Configuration Options

```typescript
// In src/config/development.ts
export const developmentConfig = {
  useMockApis: true,                    // Enable/disable mock APIs
  payment: {
    successRate: 0.9,                   // Payment success rate
    processingTime: 2000,               // Payment processing time (ms)
  },
  creditCheck: {
    processingTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,      // Credit check processing time (ms)
    statusUpdateInterval: 10000,        // Status check interval (ms)
  },
  // ... more options
};
```

## Benefits

1. **No CORS Issues**: Development works without API keys or CORS configuration
2. **Realistic Testing**: Mock data simulates real API behavior
3. **Configurable**: Easy to adjust timing and success rates
4. **Production Ready**: Same code works in production with real APIs
5. **Better Debugging**: Development logging helps track flow

## Testing

The credit check wizard now works completely in development mode:

1. **Payment Form**: Accepts any card details (formatted for realism)
2. **Personal Info**: Collects user information
3. **Processing**: Shows realistic progress updates
4. **Report Display**: Shows mock credit report with export options

## Production Deployment

To use real APIs in production:

1. Set `useMockApis: false` in development config
2. Ensure proper CORS configuration on backend
3. Configure real Trustii API keys
4. Set up Stripe payment processing

## Files Modified

- `src/config/development.ts` (new)
- `src/services/creditCheckService.ts`
- `src/services/paymentService.ts`
- `src/components/PaymentForm.tsx`
- `src/components/CreditCheckWizard.tsx`

## Next Steps

1. Test the complete flow in development mode
2. Configure backend API endpoints for production
3. Set up proper CORS headers on backend
4. Configure real API keys for production deployment
